    #m You|3D:Player|(First I need to find a hammer and a nail box. Also planks. If I remember correctly there are storehouses in Muldraugh where all these stuff can be found. In the worst case, I will have to look in houses and garages.)

    #m You|3D:Player|"I pretty sure there's something else you can do for me."
    #m Suddenly Sally's expression sank.
    #m You|3D:Player|"For example, pull yourself together and start going out for food. I understand that you've been through a lot and now you're scared of going outside, but you don't need to worry that much."
    #m You|3D:Player|"I'm here to help you to get back on your feet."
    #m You|3D:Player|"It's not the first time I get my hands covered in the blood. How do you think I got here with all those undead outside? Over time I'll make this area safer and you'll be able to help with searching food. By that time we may as well be able to find alternative food sources."
    #m Having relaxed a little bit, Sally smiled again.
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Okay, I'll do my best."
    #m You|3D:Player|"Alright then. In the morning I'm going out on a hunt. As for now, let's drink some tea."

    #m > Today I decided to take my mind off things, and prepared a three new cocktails.
    #m > Number 1 - an improved version of Delarock with a different ratio of ingredients and weaker side-effect (hopefully).
    #m > Perhaps, I finally found what original drink was missing.
    #m > Two other cocktails don't have anything special.
    #m > Number 2 - whiskey with grapefruit juice and a mint leaf.
    #m > Number 3 - a mix of aloe and lemon infused with alcohol and diluted with dogwood juice.
    #m > I'll let them sit for a while, and later Chloe will taste them. She doesn't feel well right now.

During them Nellie asked me about my symptoms and prescribed pills with funny sounding names.
