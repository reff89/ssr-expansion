    #m You|Approaching the Farmer's shop, you see a few zombies trying to smash the door. One of them keeps hitting the glass which already starting to crack.
    #m Without wasting a moment, you deal with the undead.

    #m You|3D:Player|"How the heck did you manage to get yourself into this mess? This was one of the safest routes..."
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Promise me you won't shout at me. Well, I... uh... On my way I decided to sit in a car."
    #m You|3D:Player|"'Sit in the car'? What do you mean by that and why would you do that?"
    #m You|Sally looks nervous and embarrassed.
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Well... just... to sit. Since I never managed to get driver license I always dreamed of the car. For your information, I'm not stupid and know, that in apocalypse one must have a car! Driving is life!"
    #m You|3D:Player|"Okay and then...?"
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"So... uh... I did sit in the car, took a steering wheel and started to imagine that I'm on the highway. Around me the other and I'm taking them over... and in my fantasy I pressed the... horn..."
    #m You|3D:Player|"Why in the heaven's sake would you ever do that?
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Less than a second, I swear, pinky promise! I instantly realized what I've done, wanted to get out of the car but the door got jammed... and I panicked a little. While pulling the handle, 3 undead appeared from forest and came near the car, in one moment I managed to get out and run to the store but they followed me and surrounded me. I tried sitting quietly but as you know also, only way to distract them is using other sound... but it's so quiet here like in space!"
    #m You|3D:Player|"For the future, promise me that you won't get into the cars, okay? At least not during our supply missions."
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|" I'm sorry, I promise..."

    #m For some time now you're hearing police siren from afar.You came closer to the source of the sound just to find a car near pizza shop, it's doors open and siren echoes on the entire neighbourhood. You notice some cracks on the siren like somebody tried to silence it by plugging it with something. Zombies surrounding the car but there doesn't seem to be a lot of them attracted yet.
    #m You spot Sally behind the windows of pizzeria. She looks terrified and constantly looks around.
    #m When Sally notices you, she smiles happily. She shows you something with hand signs but due to her panic it's hard to tell what she exactly.
    #m After some time you realize what she meant, she asked if there is a safe route to leave? You carefully look around. There still aren't many zombies and for the matter of fact they are heading towards the siren which is slightly on the side. You know, that if Sally will be quiet, the undead won't pay attention to her. You give her a signal.
    #m .........
    #m ......
    #m ...
    #m After some time you and Sally finally returned to shelter.

    #m You|3D:Player|"How did it even happen?"
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Oh yeah... the story is quite... silly. When I was coming closer to the pizzeria, I saw three undead right inside the building and because of that I decided to wait out a little bit..."
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"I thought they will leave on their own... So an hour have passed but they still were walking inside. And I started to think how to lure them outside but in a way that they won't follow me, so I used rocks since I thought they will follow the sound but sounds were too quiet and then I had an eureka moment, the police car. They produce sounds, right? And they also have separate battery specifically for the siren."  
    #m You|3D:Player|"Did you seriously decide to turn on the police siren..?"
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"No wait, let me finish! Well, I found the siren control and volume regulator... and I thought that if I turn the volume all the way down, then I might have a pretty good local and not loud source of sound! But who knew, that even the lowest volume would be this loud."
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"I'm sorry that I acted so recklessly... I tried to turn it off fast but in panic I started to spin all of the switches and regulators, Then saw those three coming out of the pizza shop, got scared and ran out of the car. I hid in the forest, then slowly walked around them and shut myself in pizzeria. Then when I thought about leaving home I started to see zombies approaching because of police siren..."
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"I got terrified because there might have been somebody behind the door ready to ambush me and because of that I decided not to come out and observe. Then you appeared!"
    #m You|3D:Player|"Your adventurous spirits worthy of envy, what can I say. How could even think of something like that at all! You are one hella crazy!"
    #m Sally|3D:Sally|"Yes... It turned out stupid but hey? Look what I have found!"
