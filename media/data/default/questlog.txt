    #line Day 1 - 9:43\n\nIfan is dead.

#entry The worst moment of my life.
    #line Nobody could have imagined that such day will come. A nightmare, a streets full with complete chaos and utter despair. People attacking each other like wild animals, smearing themselves in their blood and devouring their innards like hyenas, truly a despair have befallen us. After some time the madness comes to a still and complete silence sinked in.     
    #line That day I've been attacked as well. I've been trying to reason with the bastard but all of my attempts have been met with exact same reaction - an absolute rage. That was a monster... A creature with insatiable hunger that only slightly have resembled a human being.  
    #line immunity_route|An indecisiveness have played a nasty joke with me, before I realized, this beast have already clenched it's teeth on my arm. A sharp pain released a flight'n'fight response.  
    #line With a swift movement, I've taken a nearby object with one arm and have smashed it's skull. Without waiting for help, I've rushed to run. When I came to realization, I've understood that attacks were happening everywhere. Open areas now posed a danger, so with a quick thinking I've rushed to my house and lay in waiting...
    #line immunity_route|The place where the damned zombie have bitten me was in severe pain, I've disinfected it with everything I could get my hands on but to no avail, condition didn't improve. Slowly I started feeling weak. Chills, nausea and extreme fatigue have befallen my frail body. It was obvious now, that bite wasn't just an ordinary one, something slowly but surely was dying inside of me hence these awful symptoms. Some time later... I lost my consciousness.
    #line immunity_route|Believe me, I did watch zombie movies and know how it usually goes, vaccine doesn't exist and regardless how strong the hope is... Anyone who have been infected faced inescapable death and turned into one of these things. And me... Well, can't say I've immediately have accepted my fate but subconscious part definitely didn't let me even try fighting. The shocking surprise came when I actually woke up, alive and perfectly healthy, now that's a twist of fate if there is one!
    #line immunity_route|The wound from the bite seems to be healed completely and I feel amazing, does it mean everything is behind now? Probably not, since there is still these monsters outside lurking in the daylight.
    #line Since my predicament, I decided to figure out the situation by using mass media in hopes to learn something, apparently the infection spreads via air droplets. First infected just breathed it in and the rest have been bitten. There is possibility of some survivors left in the state, will try looking for them.
    #line evil_route|Those who knew that side of me are most likely long dead, but in reality I'm one hella of piece of shit. I love tormenting people, make them trust me, manipulate them and then observe how their world slowly crumbles into tiny little pieces in their eyes, its an absolute pleasure I enjoy. Might be by chance a mere fetish or by chance new form of cannibalism? Regardless of how much I've tried to suppress this demon in myself, that I hide behind these mask of kind samaritan, eventually it takes an upper hand.
#entry Grieving Drunkard
    #line Passing by one of the stores, I heard some loud racket and quite loud sobbing, I became curious so I got myself inside through the window only to find some young woman in her late 20s buried under a lot of bottles.
    #line That was a quite bizarre sight to behold but disgusting smell of alcohol didn't let me stand by and observe it. I came closer to check up on her but guess what? The woman screamed at the top of her lungs and threw a closest bottle in my face. It barely missed my head and got smashed on the wall, surprising accuracy it is for a drunkard that can barely stand on their own two feet. Was lucky enough that she got blinded by the daylight or else that bottle would have found it's place on my face.
    #line After spending quite an effort, I finally managed to calm her down, after that we had a normal conversation.
    #line Woman's name was Sally, she told me that she was alone and knowing not where to go, locked herself in this place. Shackled by the fear, she was hiding here unable to sleep. Obviously this couldn't have gone for long, so in order to calm her nerves she decided to drink some alcohol from the bottles that were left... And as you probably have guessed, that's the current situation.
    #line Without thinking I decided to offer my help to her. Sally was reluctant for few moments before finally agreeing and how could you not understand her distrust? Unsurprisingly, she was just like me, haven't seen any living people for quite some time.
    #line Store obviously was the best shelter, of course there is a lot of precious resources but due to huge amount of open space, it's rather awful place to protect. We needed find some better shelter or reinforce the current one somehow. Since Sally had a huge fear of going outside, we were only left with reinforcement option. I told her that I'll look for the needed tools and materials.
    #line gd_msq1_cleared|I nailed all the windows with some planks and whatever I could found in the store, it should be relatively safe... Hopefully.
    #line gd_msq2_intro|I came up with a worthy challenge for Sally and that is going to the other side of the city... To my big shock, she agreed to it with a huge enthusiasm, what a surprise I thought to myself.
    #line gd_msq3_intro|Sally have asked me to check a tavern in southern part of Muldraugh for one of the cocktails and hopefully a recipe for it, assuming there is one.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_e|After venturing there... In end I returned empty handed, unfortunately.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_a|Found some kind of cocktail there, after returning we drank it together. The drink was sourer than a damn lemon, it was not something you would expect, but everyone was satisfied.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_b|Found some kind of cocktail there, after returning we drank it together. The drink was surprisingly heavy and knocked me down from my legs really fast I must say.
    #line gd_msq3_route_c,gd_msq3_recipe|To my shock, the secret recipe of cocktail that Sally was loving, apparently had some drugs in it which explains the knocking power of the drink.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_c|I have told my honest truth to Sally, like it is. She definitely was sad for a time being but that helped her let go all of that weight that was piled up on her heart. In the end this helped her to come up with recipe for cocktail that doesn't require drugs to have same knocking power, impressive drink I must say.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_d|Without saying anything, I've given the recipe to Sally and the cocktail made by her was definitely not bad at all.
    #line gd_msq3_ending_f|With excitement I made Sally drink it and sight afterwards was quite "exciting".
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,gd_msq3_recipe|Since Sally knows the recipe now, if I bring her all the necessary ingredients, she would be able to mix the cocktail anytime.
    #line gd_msq3_route_g|I tried to make Sally drink it, but she saw through my malicious intent, what a blunder.
    #line gd_msq3_route_g,gd_msq3_ending_g|In the end I had to spectacularly drink that shit myself. Only this way I could bring back her trust in me... I still feel unwell even few days later.
    #line gd_msq3_route_g,gd_bad_ending_1|Using the the first opportunity, Sally has escaped... Obviously she didn't want to be near somebody who she couldn't trust at all. Where she is now and if she still there, this I might never know in my lifetime.
    #line gd_eq1_ending_a|When we were spending night in southern gas station of Muldraugh, me and Sally decided to play hide and seek... And in the woman's restroom... I've seen "something"... something out of this world... This still gives me unrest just remembering it... What exactly was that?   
    #line gd_eq1_ending_b|When we were spending night in southern gas station of Muldraugh, me and Sally decided to play hide and seek. There wasn't much places to hide so obviously I won quite easily.       
    #line gd_msq2_cleared|And with this our amazing adventure with Sally have come to an end... To be continued?
#entry Huntress
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,h_chloe|Among the usual tenants of the tavern at south of Muldraugh, there was a ruthless person who loved feasting on hearts of innocent girls (and not just hearts). From diary of Chloe, a waitress at the tavern, turns out the name of that woman was Hanna.
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,h_perfume|What we know is that woman uses perfumes with smell of cherries.
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,h_broken_nail|Near the bath where I found somebody's nail, I also found a small case and apparently, all of its contents are now in her possession.
#entry Mad Scientist
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,ms_science_book|One of the tenants in tavern on south of Muldraugh, was a person who's name is Alexander, and apparently he was a virologist. If he is a alive, we might have some very important things to talk about and by chance he has some idea where could have this virus possibly originated from.
    #line gd_msq3_cleared,ms_science_book,h_broken_nail|Especially considering the fact the guy knew of the contents inside the case, stolen by other roomer.
